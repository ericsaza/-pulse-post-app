# PulsePost
This is a web page created by me, which is supposedly a social network where everyone can create posts, delete them and edit them (which is a CRUD in Firebase).

# Attributes:
- Intuitive and easy to use user interface.
- Login with username/password, Google or Github.
- You can create a post, edit it, delete it and obviously view it.

# Screenshots:
- Pàgina de inicio.
